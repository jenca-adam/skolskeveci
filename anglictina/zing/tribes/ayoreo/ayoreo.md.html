<h1>AYOREO PEOPLE</h1>
<h2>1.0 Introduction</h2>

<p><strong>Ayoreo people</strong> are nomadic hunter-gatherer  indigenous tribe living in <strong>Gran Chaco</strong> on borders of <strong>Paraguay</strong> and <strong>Bolivia</strong>.<br>
Their population is around <strong>5,600</strong> <!--(3,000 in Bolivia; 2,600 in Paraguay)-->.
There are small groups of them (around <strong>100</strong> in total) that remain <strong>uncontacted</strong>.</p>

<h2>1.1 Voluntarily isolated groups</h2>

Uncontacted groups are <b>voluntarily isolated</b>. 
They don't really want to see modern civilisation, 
<br>
but they are threatened by massive deforestation and cattle farming.
They struggle to avoid contact, they even need to communicate with whistles because they don't want to be detected.

When deforestation came too far and they had only small patches of forest between fields to hide,<br> 
a small group was forced to make contact. <!--The group called themselves <b>Areguede'urasade</b><br>-->
Finally, they had to give up their  culture.
As result of this contact, several health issues began.
