<h1>AYOREO PEOPLE</h1>

<h2>1.0 Introduction</h2>

<p><strong>Ayoreo people</strong> are nomadic hunter-gatherer  indigenous tribe living in <strong>Gran Chaco</strong> on borders of <strong>Paraguay</strong> and <strong>Bolivia</strong>.<br>
Their population is around <strong>5,600</strong> (3,000 in Bolivia; 2,600 in Paraguay).
There are small groups of them (around <strong>100</strong> in total) that remain <strong>uncontacted</strong>.</p>

<h2>1.1 Voluntary isolated groups</h2>

Uncontacted groups are <b>voluntary isolated</b>, it means they don't really want to see modern civilisation, <br>but they are sometimes forced to.
In 2004, seventeen of them complained because of <b>massive deforestation</b>. The group called themselves <b>Areguede'urasade</b>. While they were in forest, they struggled to avoid contact with outsiders, they even needed to communicate with whistles because they didn't want to be heard.<br>
Finally, Areguede'urasade <b> converted to Christianity</b>.
As result of this contact, <b>several health issues</b> began.
