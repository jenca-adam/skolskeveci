AYOREO PEOPLE
 1.0 Introduction

Ayoreo people are nomadic hunter-gatherer indigenous tribe living in
Gran Chaco on borders of Paraguay and Bolivia.  
Their population is around 5,600 (3,000 in Bolivia; 2,600 in Paraguay).
There are small groups of them (around 100 in total) that remain
uncontacted.

 1.1 Voluntary isolated groups

Uncontacted groups are voluntary isolated , it means they don't really
want to see modern civilisation,  
but they are sometimes forced to. In 2004, seventeen of them complained
because of massive deforestation. The group called themselves
Areguede'urasade. While they were in forest, they struggled to avoid
contact with outsiders, they even needed to communicate with whistles because
they didn't want to be heard.  
Finally, Areguede'urasade were forced to give up their culture. As result
of this contact, several health issues began.
