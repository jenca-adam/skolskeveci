Good morning,

my name is Edward Malone and I am news reporter working for Daily Gazette.
Our redaction is very interested to make an interview with you about 
your trip to South America to prove our readers you are telling the truth.
I know that you are reluctant to make interviews, but please listen to us:
we believe that you are telling the truth, but some people still think that you are the liar.
Please, prove them you saw what you say and you deserve the Nobel Prize.
Can we meet next Wednesday in your house?

Sincerely yours
	
	Edward Malone
